## Remote Administration Tool project named RTerminal
This project is aimed at testing my capability to build such a project.
Anyone is welcome to contribute.

This project is being currently scaled down for a more modular approach. This module will focus on the RAT part. It works as follows : after the privilege escallation phase the `dropper.py` file will be executed with admin privileges and will perform os detection to adapt the installation to the specific OS. Afterwards the client will automaticly reach out to the server and will establish connection, the server being the attacker's machine in this case. 

## Module's place in project
Note that this project is a standalone but will be able to combine with the bontnet gestion module, so if you compromise 10 machines with this rat you will be able to upgrade your machines into a botnet with a commande that does not yet existe. 
     
## Disclaimer
This tool is not profesional by any means, it is a challenge for myself and anyone willing to contribute. I do not encourage or support any illegal use of this software. This software should only be used for testing purposes and explicitly authorized by the machine's orner.
