## This is a botnet project named RTerminal
This project is aimed at testing my capability to build such a project.
Anyone is welcome to contribute.

Even though the project is still a bit sketchy the Bots are organized as such:
Admin which has maximum level access (DB unrestricted access). 
Server which takes orders from the admin (DB unrestricted access).
Commander which takes orders from the server or admin (DB restricted access).
Target which takes orders from the server or admin or the commander (no DB access).
