## Remote Administration Tool project named RTerminal
The RTerminal (Remote Terminal) tool is built as a way to test my capabilities and to build up my knowledges in the C programming language. 

## Module's place in project
This tool is built to be a standalone but has another objective in a larger scope. It is part of a botnet project named GControl (Global Control). The RTerminal section will allow a remote server to deal with all the targets and launch large scale attacks (DDoS for instance).

## Next changes
- Finish the `installer.c` file
- Write the `client.c` file 

## Disclaimer
This tool is not profesional by any means, it is a challenge for myself and anyone willing to contribute. I do not encourage or support any illegal use of this software. This software should only be used for testing purposes and explicitly authorized by the machine's orner.
