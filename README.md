## This is a Remote Administration Tool project named RTerminal
This project is aimed at testing my capability to build such a project.
Anyone is welcome to contribute.

This project is being currently scaled down for a more modular approach. This module will focus on the RAT part. It works as follows : after the privilege escallation phase the `dropper.py` file will be executed with admin privileges and will perform os detection to adapt the installation to the specific OS. Afterwards the client will automaticly reach out to the server and will establish connection.
